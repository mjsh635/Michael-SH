  The problem, called the Monty Hall problem, is there are 3 doors, and you are asked to pick a door. Then Monty the host opens another door that has a goat behind it. He then asks if you would like to stay with your door, or switch the the other closed door.
  
  The code included allows you to play the monty hall problem, or to simulate the outcome over a desired amount of iterations using Python 3 or C#.
